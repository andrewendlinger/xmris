# Tests
Currently, the primary test suite for `xmris` is integrated into our documentation notebooks 
to ensure that all tutorials and examples remain functional and scientifically accurate.

You can find the test cases here:
👉 `docs/notebooks/`

These are executed via `uv run pytest` (using the `nbmake` plugin).
